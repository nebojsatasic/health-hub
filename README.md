# Health Hub

## Introduction

This website is designed to provide users with reliable and up-to-date information on wellness, nutrition, fitness, and medical conditions. The blog aims to promote a healthier lifestyle by offering easy access to informative articles that help individuals stay informed and make better health decisions.

The website is built using the PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, following an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. By leveraging the MVC pattern, the project ensures a clean separation of concerns, making it flexible and extendable, as well as maintainable and easy to manage. Additionally, the use of OOP principles fosters code reusability, modularity, and enhanced project efficiency.

## Features

* User Registration & Login: Users can create an account and log in to access additional features.
* Post Management: Logged-in users can read, write, update, and delete their own posts.
* Different Views for Anonymous and Logged-in Users: Anonymous users are directed to the homepage (pages/index), while logged-in users are taken to the posts index page (posts/index).

## Technologies Used

* PHP 8.2 (Object-Oriented Programming, MVC structure)
* HTML 5 for semantic markup
* Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
* MySQL for database management

## Future Updates

Future updates will be implemented based on the custom MVC framework that I have already created for the project. These updates will include:

* Categories - Introduce post categories for better organization and navigation.
* Comments - Allow users to leave comments on posts to encourage interaction.
* Images - Enable users to upload and associate images with their posts.
* User Roles - Implement different user roles (e.g., regular user, admin) to control permissions and access levels.
* Admin Panel - Develop an admin panel to manage users, posts, and other administrative functions.
